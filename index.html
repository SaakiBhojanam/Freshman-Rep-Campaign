        <h2>Help Underclassmen Better Understand Competitive Events</h2>

        <h3>Event Information Sessions</h3>
        <p>
            Conduct workshops or seminars focusing on different competitive events within FBLA. Break down the rules, criteria, and expectations for each event. Use real examples and success stories to illustrate the practical aspects.
        </p>

        <h3>Peer-to-Peer Mentoring</h3>
        <p>
            Pair underclassmen with experienced FBLA members who have excelled in specific events. This mentorship program can offer personalized guidance, sharing strategies, tips, and reviewing project ideas.
        </p>

        <h3>Practice Competitions</h3>
        <p>
            Currently, this is only possible with testing events during the Fall Testing Series. However, we could organize practice rounds or simulations for competitive events within the chapter. Underclassmen can participate and receive constructive feedback from mentors or senior members to improve their understanding and performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Resource Libraries</h3>
        <p>
            Create easily accessible online resources or physical libraries that contain materials, sample projects, past submissions, and study guides specifically tailored to different competitive events. Ensure these resources are easily available for underclassmen. Currently, the only study materials accessible are extremely outdated.

        <h2>Create Interest in FBLA at a Younger Age</h2>

        <h3>Information Sessions and Workshops</h3>
        <p>
            Organize interactive and informative sessions in local middle schools to introduce the concept of FBLA. These sessions can include engaging presentations, activities, and discussions led by current FBLA members who can share their experiences and the benefits of joining FBLA in high school. These could be integrated into the business classes at these schools.
        </p>

        <h3>Hands-On Activities</h3>
        <p>
            Offer workshops or activities that demonstrate basic business principles or showcase simple entrepreneurial tasks. This hands-on approach could involve team challenges, mini-projects, or games that expose middle school students to the core elements of FBLA.
        </p>

        <h3>Community Participation</h3>
        <p>
            Participate in various events in the community, and set up booths or presentations specifically dedicated to FBLA. Highlight the opportunities, competitions, and experiences that students can gain by joining FBLA in high school.
